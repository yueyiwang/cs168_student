Reasons not speed of light:
1.) The ping does not travel through air and is not a straight line, so it will be slowed down through the different mediums (i.e. glass, fiber). 
2.) There is no router that directly connects between Berkeley and each server so there will be extra distance and possible traffic to cause queuing delays and each router can cause transmission delays.

e.) One advantage of stable is that you can store less data since you only need one router for each destination. 





2.
a.) 
route-server.ip-plus.net
# hops from my computer to server: 14
# hops from server to my computer: 13

route-views.oregon-ix.net
# hops from my computer to server: 8
# hops from server to my computer: 8

route-views.on.bb.telus.com
# hops from my computer to server: 10
# hops from server to my computer: 13

route-server.east.bb.allstream.net
# hops from my computer to server: 11 + dropped
# hops from server to my computer: 1 + dropped

b.) All 4 are non symmetric
c.) Routers may share same IP address, router failure, redirection of heavy traffic (different optimized path)

Facebook is different
us vs. france 
157.240.2.35 vs 31.13.92.36
57.921 vs. 162.472

They are traveling different routes to different locations. They have different DNS servers for different locations, so it’ll travel to the closest one.


f) It would be faster. Without +trace, the target nameserver resolves the query directly instead of resolving the query and reporting each result from the top down.
